### 📊 Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

#### ✅ **Task 5 – Data Analyst Internship**

---

### 📁 **Objective**

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to extract meaningful insights, identify patterns, and visualize trends from the **Titanic Dataset** using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

---

### 🛠️ **Tools Used**

* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Jupyter Notebook

---

### 📌 **Key Steps Performed**

1. **Loaded and viewed the dataset** (`train.csv` from Titanic dataset)
2. **Checked for null values and data types** using `.info()` and `.isnull().sum()`
3. **Summarized statistics** using `.describe()`
4. **Univariate analysis** with histograms and boxplots
5. **Bivariate analysis** using bar plots, scatter plots, and box plots
6. **Multivariate analysis** using correlation matrix and heatmaps
7. **Visualized relationships** between features like `Survived`, `Sex`, `Age`, and `Pclass`
8. **Wrote observations and summarized findings**

---

### 📌 **Visualizations Created**

* Histograms (Age, Fare)
* Boxplots (Age by Pclass, Fare)
* Countplots (Survived vs Sex, Pclass)
* Heatmap (Feature Correlation)
* Pairplot (Age, Fare, Pclass vs Survived)

---

### 📈 **Insights & Observations**

* Females had a higher survival rate than males.
* Passengers in 1st class were more likely to survive than those in 3rd class.
* Younger passengers had slightly better survival chances.
* There is a moderate correlation between Fare and Pclass.
* Data contains missing values in `Age` and `Cabin`.
